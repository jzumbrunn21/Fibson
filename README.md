# Fibson

Currently refactoring with Material UI instead of vanilla CSS.

Fibson, an e-commerce platform, is a haven for guitar enthusiasts worldwide. Drawing inspiration from the renowned Gibson.com, Fibson offers a comprehensive and user-friendly interface that caters to every guitar lover’s needs. Upon creating an account, users are welcomed into a vibrant marketplace where they can explore a vast array of guitars for sale. From novice musicians looking for their first instrument to seasoned professionals seeking a unique addition to their collection, everyone can find something that resonates with them. But Fibson’s offerings don’t stop at buying guitars. It also provides a platform for users to sell their own guitars, fostering a dynamic community of buyers and sellers. This feature not only allows users to declutter their collection but also gives others the opportunity to own pre-loved guitars with a history. In essence, Fibson is more than just a marketplace; it’s a community that brings guitar enthusiasts together, fueling their passion for music.

### Guitar Detail Page & Shopping Cart
The guitar detail page uses React Carousel to display the guitar's image. Below the carousel are sections for guitar specifications and a user posted reviews. If the user does not own the guitar listing, they will be able to add it to their shopping cart. The cart can increment and decrement an item. Finally, a user can 'checkout' and finalize their shopping cart for purchase.
